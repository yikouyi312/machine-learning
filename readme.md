# HMM
* Implement a named entity recognition system using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
* Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of classifying named entities, typically proper nouns, into pre-defined categories, such as person, location, or organization.
* Model
  - Hidden Markov Model

# NLP
* Implement a working Natural Language Processing (NLP) system using binary logistic regression.
* Model
  - Logistic regression classifier

# OCR(neural network)
* Implement a neural network to classify images using a single hidden layer neural network
* Model
  - Single-hidden-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer, and a softmax on the output layer.

# Decision tree
* Implement a binary classifier, entirely from scratchâ€“specifically a Decision Tree learner
* Model
  - Decision Tree Learner

# Q-learning
